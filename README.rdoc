== tcs_merb_gem_bundler

A gem that provides a functional gem bundler for merb 0.9.12 and higher!

Tim Carey-Smith made this for our project at work.  We don't waste time with
gem conflicts anymore.

This basically sets up a gems/ folder inside of your merb application.  A set
of scripts are provided that override the gem paths accordingly.  Here's a
rundown of the files provided and their purpose.

You get a binary called 'tcs_merb_gem_bundler' run it from your application's root

* config/dependencies.rb - a list of the gems your app relies on.  
* script/update - a script that parses your gems.yml file and installs what's missing
* script/check  - ensure that the merb environment cab be started w/ the new gem environment
* bin/spec      - load the spec executable with the correct gem environment
* bin/rake      - load the rake executable with the correct gem environment
* bin/merb      - load the merb executable with the correct gem environment
* bin/merb-gen  - load the merb executable with the correct gem environment
